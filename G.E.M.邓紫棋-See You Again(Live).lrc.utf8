[00:00.74]It's been a long day without you my friend
[00:05.48]And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
[00:09.65]We've come a long way from where we began
[00:14.41]Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
[00:19.02]When I see you again
[00:21.14]When I see you again
[00:59.87]When I see you again
